# XyloPhone-iOS-App

First Musical Instrument App. 

Musical Instrument Apps are so popular on the App Store that they have their own category. So here is one of my creations to add on to the stack.

Concepts: 
  1. How to play sound using AVFoundation and AVAudioPlayer.
  2. Understand Apple documentation and how to use StackOverflow.
  3. Functions and methods in Swift.
  4. Data types.
  5. Swift loops.
  6. Variable scope.
  7. The ViewController lifecycle.
  8. Error handling in Swift.
  9. Code refactoring.
 10. Basic debugging.
